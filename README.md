# OpenCVLabJam
Necessary source files and resources for the Iowa State Spring 2016 OpenCV Lab Jam

## Setup
### Installing OpenCV
Follow [this link](http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_setup/py_setup_in_windows/py_setup_in_windows.html#install-opencv-python-in-windows) to install the OpenCV Libraries in Windows.

Follow [this link](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_install/linux_install.html) to install the OpenCV libraries in Linux.

Follow [this link](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/15/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-2-7-on-osx/) to install the OpenCV libraries in OS X.

If you are using the yum package manager (Fedora or other relative distros), the following command should successfully install OpenCV:

`sudo yum install numpy opencv*`

This may not give you access to the latest OpenCV version like building from source, so there may be compatibility issues involved.  It's worth a shot to try.

### Install a Python Editor
You can use whatever editor you want for this.  I would recommend [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).  Visual Studio and XCode are also great options.
